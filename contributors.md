# Support Neptune Development

Neptune is a free program, and currently only one person is involved in the development of the content of the project (including the main program, website content, etc. The website uses the Shards theme). In fact, it is very difficult for one person to develop this program and still need to find many functions. (For example, it took me nearly a year to research how to replace the photo of a job.) If you are an individual user and enjoy the productivity of using Neptune, please consider supporting us by providing us with more information or other ways. You can provide us with more information via info@neptune.work.
